    /*Part I
Recreate the base Ninja class from scratch using ES6 classes. Your Ninja needs the following attributes:

name
health
speed
strength
Speed and strength should be 3 by default. Health should be 100 by default. Do not worry about private variables.

The Ninja class should have the following methods:

sayName() - This should log that Ninja's name to the console.
showStats() - This should show the Ninja's Strength and Speed, as well as their health.
drinkSake() - This should add +10 Health to the Ninja 
    */
class Ninja {
    constructor (name, health = 100, speed = 3, strength = 3){
        self = this;
        this.name = name;
        this.health = health;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.strength = strength;
    }
    sayName() {
        console.log(self.name);
    };
    showStats(){
        console.log("name: " + self.name + ", health: " + self.health + ", speed: " + self.speed + ", strength: " + self.strength);
    };
    drinkSake(){
        self.health += 10;
    };
};

/* Part II - Sensei Class
Extend the Ninja class and create the Sensei class. A Sensei should have 200 Health, 10 speed, and 10 strength 
by default. In addition, a Sensei should have a new attribute called wisdom, and the default should be 10. Finally, 
add the speakWisdom() method. speakWisdom() should call the drinkSake() method from the Ninja class, before 
console.logging a wise message. */

class Sensei extends Ninja {
    constructor (name, health = 200, speed = 10, strength = 10, wisdom =10){
        super(name, health, speed, strength);
        this.wisdom = wisdom;
        self = this;
/*      could've done this:
        super(name);
		this.speed = 10;
		this.strength = 10;
		this.wisdom = 10;
		this.health = 200; */
    }

        super.drinkSake();
